# TODO

- PQueue for week5

- week6: watch lectures
- week6: Problem: Compute Distance Faster Using Coordinates
    - week6: bidirectional A*
    - minimum: read up on this and wrote pseudocode
    - max: prep data
    - graph with LAT/LNG ... edges .. weights .. edge labels
        - use lib to compute dis from LAT/LNG
        - straight line faster than great circle (tunnel through earth)
    - dream: visualize our computed routea
- week6: prep a dataset (e.g. openstreet map)

- Chat about `decomposition2.pdf`: 5.2 "Designing an algo" .. thinking about runtime vs computer  speed
