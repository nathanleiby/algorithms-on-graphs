# TODO

- week5:
  - [ ] PQueue for performance
- week6: Problem: Compute Distance Faster Using Coordinates
    - [ ] watch lectures
    - [ ] read up on this and wrote pseudocode
    - [ ] prep a dataset (e.g. openstreet map)
      - choose a dataset
      - format it into a graph with LAT/LNG ... edges .. weights .. edge labels
        - use lib to compute dis from LAT/LNG .. straight line faster than great circle (tunnel through earth)
    - [ ] dream: visualize our computed routea
- Chat about `decomposition2.pdf`: 5.2 "Designing an algo" .. thinking about runtime vs computer  speed
